In the late 1970s, I wrote my first lines of code on India’s first digital computer—designed at Bhabha Atomic Research Center. It was a 12-bit machine, with 4KB of RAM, no hard disk, and a bootstrap loader entered in binary via bulky mechanical switches.

The world has changed. My curiosity hasn’t.

Since 2018, I’ve maintained [winkNLP](https://github.com/winkjs/wink-nlp)—a developer-friendly NLP library with zero-dependency, ~100% test coverage and OpenSSF-aligned security practices. In 2024, it received India’s top AI honor: the NASSCOM AI Game Changer award.

Currently working on [winkComposer](https://github.com/winkjs/wink-composer)—a streaming analytics framework for Node.js. It turns continuous data into insights using a reactive graph that adapts under load, supports both CPU- and I/O-bound tasks, and integrates LLM-powered reasoning with graph-based digital twins. It's early days, and your ideas are welcome.

I am also curious about quantum computing ⚛️. Often found in the kitchen 🍲 when not at the keyboard 👨‍💻.
